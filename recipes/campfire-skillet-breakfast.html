    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cross between a potato hash and a cheesy frittata, this classic camping breakfast is often referred to as a “Mountain Man Breakfast”. We have no idea where the name came from (and neither does Google apparently) but what we do know is it’s incredibly easy to make, super satisfying to eat, and quick to clean up. All you need is a single skillet!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound sliced bacon</li>
        <li>4 cups potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped (Optional)</li>
        <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon to desired doneness in a cast iron skillet over the slow burning coals of a campfire. Remove bacon from the skillet and set aside. Stir the potatoes and onion into the hot bacon fat. Cover, and cook until the potatoes are soft, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble the bacon into the potatoes. Stir in the eggs, cover, and cook until set through, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the cheese, and allow to melt before serving.</li>
    </ol>
