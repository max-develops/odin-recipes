        <li>Cocoa powder: for more taste and calories, unsweetened cocoa powder is also highly nutritious.</li>
        <li>Milk of choice: use dairy milk or go for dairy-free alternatives, if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Egg whites: these add protein and make your oats incredibly delicious. Replace with more milk if you follow a vegan diet.</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot combine rolled oats, cocoa powder, peanut butter, maple syrup (or honey) and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Pour into the pot the milk, liquid egg whites (or more milk) and turn on heat. Simmer over medium heat for around 5 minutes, or until the oatmeal reaches the desired texture. Make sure you stir your oats so that they do not stick to the pan.</li>

    <ol> 
        <p><strong>Protein Powder Option</strong></p>
